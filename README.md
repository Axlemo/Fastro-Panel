# Fastro Panel
A small dashboard project with no specific purpose. Target is to be as object-oriented as possible.

### What actually is this?
Fastro consists of 3 core features:
- Authentication
- Webpage serving
- Static resource serving

It's meant to be a very stripped-down, almost template-like system to build on top of.
The main reason for it is so you can add your own features to it easily; configuring/adding webpages and routes + more!

### Object Orientation
Fastro was first built in _JavaScript_, not a typed language and messy at times.
It has been converted to _TypeScript_, allowing for unlimited amounts of object-orientation to make code cleaner and more modular.

The intention here is to create a website with maximum object-orientation and code organization, to once again take modularity to its peak.
Fastro is here to be ready, be configured, and be modified for your own projects.
