# Fastro Panel
A small dashboard project with no specific purpose. Target is to be as object-oriented and modular as possible.

### What actually is this?
Fastro consists of 3 core features:
- Dynamic resource serving
- Static resource serving
- Authentication

It's meant to be a very stripped-down, almost template-like system to build on top of. Just not a 
The main reason for it is so you can add your own features to it easily; configuring/adding webpages and routes + more!

### Object Orientation
Fastro was first built in **JavaScript**, an untyped language and messy at times.
It has been converted to **TypeScript**, allowing for unlimited amounts of object-orientation to make code cleaner.

The intention here is to create a web server with maximum object-orientation and code organization, to once again take modularity to its peak.
Fastro is here to be configured, be modified, and be ready to suit your own projects.

### Running this at home
To take Fastro and run it for yourself, you'll need **NodeJS v16** or later.
_Ensure that you've also got **TypeScript** installed._
```css
In the root directory of the project, run the following commands:

> npm install
> npm run build

Wait for completion, then...

> npm start
```
If there are any errors present during the build phase, create a new issue on Fastro's GitHub.
