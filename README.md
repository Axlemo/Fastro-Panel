# Fastro Panel
A small dashboard project with no specific purpose. Target is to be as object-oriented as possible.

### What actually is this?
Fastro consists of 3 core features:
- Authentication
- Webpage serving
- Static resource serving

It's meant to be a very stripped-down, almost template-like system to build on top of.
The main reason for it is so you can add your own features to it easily; configuring/adding webpages and routes + more!

### Object Orientation
Fastro was first built in **_JavaScript_**, an untyped language and messy at times.
It has been converted to **_TypeScript_**, allowing for unlimited amounts of object-orientation to make code cleaner and more modular.

The intention here is to create a website with maximum object-orientation and code organization, to once again take modularity to its peak.
Fastro is here to be ready, be configured, and be modified for your own projects.

### Running this at home
To take Fastro and run it for yourself, you'll need **_Node.JS @ v14_** or later.
> In the root directory of the project, run:
```css
npm run build
```
> Wait for completion, then...
```css
node startup.js
```
_Ensure that you've also got **TypeScript** installed._
